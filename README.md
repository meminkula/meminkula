# Emin KULA || AI & Data Engineering Student | Cyber Security

I am an AI & Data Engineering student exploring the foundations of cyber security and system programming.

### Technical Proficiency

* **Offensive Security:** Actively learning to utilize and research popular cybersecurity tools. I focus on understanding the underlying logic of tools and how they interact with network protocols.
* **System Programming:** Gaining experience in low-level development with C. I rely on technical documentation, man pages, and source code analysis to build custom utilities. I am a firm believer in the "learning by doing" approach.
* **Linux Environment:** Comfortable working within Linux-based ecosystems (specifically Kali Linux). Focused on shell environments, basic scripting, and system configuration for security labs.
* **Security Research:** Interested in deconstructing exploits and understanding their mechanisms through code review and research papers.

### Strategic Interests
* **AI in SecOps:** Exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating threat detection.
* **Cyber Intelligence:** Bridging technical security with linguistic research (Currently learning Chinese for international security context).
* **Security Tooling:** Moving beyond pre-built tools to develop native, specialized security applications in C and eventually C++.

### 📂 Active Development
* [Basic-Port-Scanner](https://github.com/meminkula/Basic-Port-Scanner): A basic custom network reconnaissance tool implemented in C using the Linux Socket API.
* [LinInject-Core](https://github.com/meminkula/LinInject-Core): A low-level system security tool developed in C that demonstrates Process Injection techniques on Linux systems using the ptrace system call.
